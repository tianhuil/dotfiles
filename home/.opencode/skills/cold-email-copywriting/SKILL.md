# Cold Email Copywriting

This skill teaches research-backed principles for writing high-performing cold emails. Apply to B2B/B2C outreach, lead generation, partnership requests, recruiting, or any unsolicited email to start a conversation.

---

## Before Writing: Research & Foundation

Cold email only works on solid research. Writing without this foundation produces generic emails that get ignored.

**Required inputs before drafting:**
- Recipient's name, company, title, and role
- A specific, recent trigger event (LinkedIn post, funding round, job posting, award, product launch, news mention)
- The recipient's likely pain point — stated in their own language, not yours
- One concrete benefit or result your offer provides, with a number if possible
- Social proof relevant to this specific recipient (customer in their industry, competitor, shared connection)

**The test:** Could this email be sent, word-for-word, to 100 different people? If yes, rewrite it.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Make it about them, not you
The prospect cares about their problems and goals, not your company.

- ❌ "We are a leading AI-powered CRM platform founded in 2019..."
- ✅ "I noticed [Company] recently expanded to three new markets — managing that pipeline manually gets painful fast."

Every use of "I" or "we" should be offset by more uses of "you" and "your." If the first sentence is about you, rewrite it.

### 2. Be radically specific
Specificity signals homework and builds credibility. Generic claims are invisible.

- ❌ "We've helped many companies improve their sales process."
- ✅ "We helped a 40-person SaaS team in fintech cut their sales cycle from 47 to 28 days."

Use numbers, company names, timeframes, and concrete outcomes.

### 3. Keep it short
Target **75–150 words** for the email body. Upper ceiling: 200 words for complex B2B sales. Anything longer will not be fully read.

Remove sentences that:
- Restate something already said
- Explain company history or backstory
- Qualify or hedges the main claim unnecessarily
- Could be cut without losing the core message

### 4. Write like a human, not a marketer
Aim for the tone of a thoughtful colleague, not a campaign.

- No exclamation points
- No ALL CAPS
- No marketing jargon: "synergy," "leverage," "game-changer," "revolutionary," "cutting-edge," "best-in-class"
- No filler phrases: "I hope this email finds you well," "I wanted to reach out because..."
- No formal sign-offs in casual emails
- Use contractions (you're, we've, it's)
- Write at a 5th–8th grade reading level

### 5. One email, one ask
Each cold email should have exactly one call to action. Multiple options create decision paralysis and reduce replies.

## Anatomy of a Cold Email

### Subject Line
Write it last, after the body is complete.

**Data-backed rules:**
- Keep it to **2–5 words** (6–7 at most); shorter outperforms longer
- Use **lowercase** — reads as personal, not promotional
- **Personalize** it with recipient's name, company, or relevant detail; ~46% open rate vs ~35% without
- **Ask a question** — question format averages 46% open rate
- Avoid: urgency words ("ASAP," "last chance"), generic greetings, hype adjectives, your company name
- Never mention AI, "quick call," or sales pitch language in subject

**High-performing patterns:**
```
[first name], quick question
[company]'s [specific challenge]?
idea for [company]
[mutual connection] suggested I reach out
[specific trigger event reference]
[number] ideas for [their goal]
```

### Opening Line (The Hook)
First sentence must be 100% about the recipient. Reference something specific that proves you've done research.

**Hook types (in order of effectiveness):**
1. **Trigger event** — Recent funding round, new hire, product launch, job posting, LinkedIn post, podcast appearance, company milestone
2. **Observation** — Specific, informed observation about their business, website, content, or market position
3. **Compliment** (use sparingly) — Genuine, specific compliment about their work. Avoid generic praise.
4. **Pain-based** — Problem statement highly specific to their role, company size, or industry

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Saw your post last week about scaling outbound without burning out your SDR team — that's exactly the problem we work on."
- ✅ "Congrats on the Series B — companies at your stage usually hit a wall with manual CRM data entry right around now."
- ✅ "Noticed [Company] has six open SDR roles on LinkedIn. Scaling a team that fast usually creates a data hygiene mess."
- ❌ "I came across your profile and was really impressed by your work."

### Body (Value Proposition)
State your offer in one to three sentences. Lead with the outcome, not the feature or the process.

**Structure:**
1. State the problem you solve (in their language)
2. State the outcome you deliver (specific, quantified if possible)
3. Add one piece of social proof (relevant company name, stat, or result)

**Examples:**
- ✅ "We help B2B SaaS companies cut time-to-close by automating the research and personalization reps currently do by hand. One team we worked with went from 47 to 28 days average sales cycle in 90 days. We've done this for [Competitor] and a few others in [their space]."
- ❌ "Our platform uses AI to streamline your sales workflow through intelligent automation and machine-learning-powered insights that integrate seamlessly with your existing tech stack."

### Call to Action (CTA)
Most cold emails fail here. Ask for too much (30-minute demo) or too vague ("let me know if you're interested") kills replies.

**Best practice — use a "soft" or "interest" CTA:**
Ask for a signal of interest, not a commitment. This dramatically lowers friction and increases replies.

- ✅ "Worth a quick conversation?"
- ✅ "Open to hearing how it works?"
- ✅ "Is this something [Company] is working on?"
- ✅ "Would it make sense to connect?"
- ❌ "Can we schedule a 30-minute demo next Tuesday at 2pm?"
- ❌ "Let me know if you'd like to learn more."
- ❌ "I'd love to connect and explore potential synergies."

**Give an opt-out:** Offering a graceful exit ("if this isn't a priority, no worries") paradoxically increases replies by removing pressure.

## Copywriting Frameworks

Use one of these frameworks to organize the email body.

### AIDA — Attention, Interest, Desire, Action
Best for: introductory emails with clear offer and strong social proof.

| Element | Purpose | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Attention | Hook with subject + opening | Personalized trigger event |
| Interest | Describe the problem they care about | "Most companies at your stage struggle with X..." |
| Desire | Show transformation your solution delivers | "We helped [Company] achieve Y in Z weeks" |
| Action | Soft CTA | "Worth a quick chat?" |

### PAS — Problem, Agitate, Solve
Best for: pain-aware audiences, competitive replacements, urgent business problems.

1. **Problem** — Name the specific pain point plainly.
2. **Agitate** — Deepen by articulating downstream consequences the reader feels but hasn't named.
3. **Solve** — Present your solution as the relief.

Example:
> "Running paid ads at [Company] without unified attribution means you're flying blind on which channels are actually working. That's budget that compounds in the wrong direction, month over month. We build attribution stacks that give teams like yours a single source of truth — usually in under three weeks."

### BAB — Before, After, Bridge
Best for: awareness-stage prospects, or when you want to paint a clear transformation.

1. **Before** — Describe the current frustrating reality.
2. **After** — Paint the desirable future state.
3. **Bridge** — Present your product or service as the path between the two.

Example:
> "Right now, your team probably spends hours each week manually pulling contact data and writing one-off personalized emails. Imagine having that process automated so reps spend their time on conversations, not research. That's what [Product] does — [Company] went from 4 hours of prep per rep per week to 20 minutes."

### One-Liner + CTA (The Goated Approach)
Best for: very senior recipients (C-suite), highly targeted micro-lists, or strong mutual context.

Write one sentence that delivers the full value proposition, followed immediately by the CTA.

Example:
> "We help fintech companies like [Company] reduce churn by 15–20% in the first 90 days using behavioral email triggers — want to see how it works for your use case?"

---

## Personalization Tiers

Match personalization depth to opportunity size and value.

| Tier | Approach | Time per email | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Deep** | Fully bespoke, custom research, specific trigger | 20–45 min | Enterprise accounts, high ACV, named accounts |
| **Segment** | Template with 2–3 customized lines (trigger + pain point for industry/role) | 5–10 min | Mid-market, defined ICP segments |
| **Persona** | Template customized for role and company stage only | 1–3 min | High-volume SMB outreach |

**Minimum personalization for any email:**
- Recipient's first name
- Company name
- One specific, research-backed reference (trigger event, observation, or pain point)

Using only a name and company name is not sufficient personalization.

---

## Social Proof Principles

Social proof converts interest into replies. Use it surgically — one strong proof point beats three weak ones.

**Hierarchy of social proof (most to least effective):**
1. Named company the recipient will recognize (competitor, industry peer, aspirational brand)
2. Quantified result with timeframe ("23% reply rate increase in 60 days")
3. Specific customer count in their vertical ("We work with 40+ B2B SaaS companies at Series A–B")
4. Case study reference ("Similar to how we helped [Company]...")
5. Generic social proof ("hundreds of customers") — last resort only

**Common mistake:** Using social proof from a completely different industry. Match the proof to the audience.

---

## Follow-up Sequences

Most replies come from follow-ups, not the first email. A single unanswered email is not a failed campaign.

**Sequence structure:**
- **Email 1** — Full cold email (Day 1)
- **Email 2** — Short bump, add new angle or resource (Day 4–5)
- **Email 3** — Shorter still, different value angle or case study (Day 8–10)
- **Email 4** — Breakup email — give them an easy out (Day 14–18)

**Follow-up rules:**
- Send as a reply in the same thread (not new email), simulates personal conversation
- Each follow-up must add something new — case study, content, different framing, or value angle
- Never just say "bumping this to the top of your inbox" or "just following up"
- Breakup email performs surprisingly well — "I'll assume the timing isn't right, but if things change..." often generates late replies

**Data point:** First follow-up boosts reply rates by ~49%. Sequences of 3–5 follow-ups outperform single emails by 65.8%.

---

## Timing Guidance

- **Best days to send:** Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
- **Best time windows:** 9–11am or 2–4pm in recipient's timezone
- **Avoid:** Monday mornings, Friday afternoons, holidays, last two weeks of December

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Why it fails | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Opening with "I hope this email finds you well" | Signals template | Open with something specific to recipient |
| Talking about yourself before third sentence | Loses reader before earning interest | Lead with their reality, not yours |
| Using passive voice throughout | Sounds corporate and lifeless | Write in active, direct sentences |
| Three or more CTAs | Decision paralysis kills reply rates | One CTA only |
| Attaching files/images in first email | Triggers spam filters, signals mass outreach | Plain text only in cold outreach |
| "Just wanted to touch base" subject lines | Vague, no clear value signal | Be specific in subject |
| Mentioning your company too many times | Makes it about you, not them | Limit company name to one mention |
| Long walls of text | Unreadable on mobile | Short paragraphs, 1–3 sentences max |
| Asking for 30 minutes in first email | Too high commitment from stranger | Ask for interest, not time |
| Assuming recipient has unexpressed problem | Feels presumptuous | Frame as question or observation, not diagnosis |

---

## Spam Avoidance (Copy-Side)

Technical deliverability aside, these copy choices affect whether you land in the inbox:

- Keep emails under 200 words; shorter emails have better deliverability
- Use plain text formatting — avoid HTML, images, and excessive links in cold emails
- Limit links to zero or one per email
- Avoid spam trigger words: "free," "guarantee," "no obligation," "click here," "earn money," "limited time," "act now," "risk-free," "winner"
- Avoid ALL CAPS in the body
- Use a real reply-to address, not no-reply
- Never use deceptive subject lines that don't match email content

### ✅ Good Cold Email
**Subject:** SDR scaling at [Company]

Noticed you have eight SDR roles open on LinkedIn — congrats on the growth, and that's a painful hiring crunch to manage at the same time.

We help SaaS companies ramp new reps 40% faster by automating their first 30 days of prospecting workflow. [Competitor] used it when they scaled from 10 to 25 reps last year.

Worth a quick conversation?

## Before Writing: Always Ask

Always ask (or infer from context) the following before writing:

1. What does the sender offer?
2. Who is the specific recipient (name, title, company)?
3. What is one recent trigger event or specific observation about the recipient?
4. What is one quantified result or relevant social proof point?
5. What action does the sender want the recipient to take?
